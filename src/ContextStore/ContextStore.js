Joyce’s ponderous words find happy union in the thoughtful eye of Hettie Macdonald, one half of the directing duo behind lockdown hit Normal People, and lush cinematography of Kate McCullough.

In spite of the two home video sequels that somehow limped out of its legacy, the film remains a remarkably risible tribute to a game of perhaps unparalleled cultural significance. Only now, two decades later, can the memory of Solomon’s effort be banished to the outer planes. Only with the release of Honour Among Thieves, which is, by all accounts, a tour-de-force of infectious blockbusting fun...",

As things stand, Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck are out, while Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa sit patiently on the bench. Robert Pattinson and Joaquin Phoenix, by contrast, enjoy a league of their own. When it comes to Shazam, the judge’s gavel has yet to fall and there’s little optimism in the jury. It would be a shame if Fury of the Gods marked the final bow for Zachary Levi’s lovably insecure supe but the battle for retention won’t be easy. It’s hard to see so second rate a sequel mirroring the success of its peppier predecessor nor enjoying anything like the audience adoration...",

It was published in 1954. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was arguably among the most brilliant Indian intellectuals of the 20th century. His life is a triumph of character over circumstances. He,for the first thirty five years of his life was subjected to the most appalling humiliations, brutal discrimination and indignities for being an untouchable. The dice was loaded against him right from his birth. He was born in a Mahar family on 14 April 1893. He died at the age of fifty six on 6th December 1956. He made it to the Elphiston College in Bombay. He could neither buy books nor clothes. He was lent books by one of his professors who also gave him clothes. At the age of 22, he was given scholarship by the enlightened Gaikward of Baroda, which enable him to join Columbia University in New York. He passed his M.A and obtained a PhD with high distinction. Similarly he did exceptionally at the London School of Economics. THE LOT of the untouchables in India were worse then that of Negros (Blacks) in America.",

Processed foods are always on-hand, which is why they make so much money for manufacturers. And they’ve saved us time and energy in the past. But, at what cost? Many of the products on this list are staples of our daily diet, from Coke to Twinkies. However, if not eaten in strict moderation (or avoided completely) they can lead to long-term health problems, according to cardiologists and other professionals. Some of these products are clearly harmful, but because they’re lucrative moneymakers they stay on the shelves anyway. Others are less obvious, but when eaten in great quantities can have nasty side effects.",
